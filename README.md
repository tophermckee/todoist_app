# Todoist Task Puller
I'm building this project as a way to keep my Todoist tasks a little closer on my brain. Some things I might do with it:
- Daily summary text message in the morning
- EOD summary of leftover tasks
- EOD rescheduling tasks to the next day
- Create a filter for **very** important tasks that will send me text messages in advance
